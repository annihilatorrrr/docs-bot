# grammYdocsbot

The [@grammYdocsbot](https://t.me/grammYdocsbot) is a Telegram bot that can be used to quickly search and send links to the documentation website of the grammY bot framework.
It is used in inline mode, i.e. by typing _@grammydocsbot search query_ in any chat field, and by selecting an article.
This is mainly useful in the [@grammyjs](https://t.me/grammyjs) community chat.

Internally, it reuses the Algolia search index that powers the search bar on <https://grammy.dev>.
